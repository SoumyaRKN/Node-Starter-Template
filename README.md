## ðŸ“¦ Versioning Using NPM

To manage semantic versioning in your Node.js project, use the following commands:

### Patch Version

Increases the last number (bug fixes, small changes):

```bash
npm version patch
```

Example: `1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1`

### Minor Version

Increases the middle number (new features, backward-compatible changes):

```bash
npm version minor
```

Example: `1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0`

### Major Version

Increases the first number (breaking changes, incompatible API changes):

```bash
npm version major
```

Example: `1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0`

---

### Notes

- Running any of these commands will also create a Git commit and tag by default.
- Make sure your repository is clean before running the command (no uncommitted changes).
